Key Points in the Project:
The "Mental Fitness Tracker" project aimed to develop an AI-powered system to monitor and support mental well-being using regression models.
The dataset was preprocessed by handling missing values and performing label encoding on categorical variables.
Exploratory data analysis techniques such as heatmaps, pair plots, and line plots were used to gain insights into the relationships between variables and mental fitness.
The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models were trained and evaluated.
The Random Forest Regressor model outperformed the Linear Regression model, achieving a higher score of 0.99 compared to 0.76.
The project demonstrated the potential of using regression models for accurate mental fitness tracking and opens avenues for further research in the field of mental health using artificial intelligence.
